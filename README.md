I've a Aquacell (https://www.aquacell-waterontharder.nl/) installed in a cabinet and want to log the level of the salt-blocks. When it's below a critical level it should send a warning to place new salt-blocks into the Aquacell. It should also send an e-mail when the stock of blocks gets empty to place a new order at https://www.aquacombi-webshop.nl/producten/regeneratiezout .
